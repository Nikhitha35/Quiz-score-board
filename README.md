# Quiz Scoreboard

## Overview

The Quiz Scoreboard is a Java-based application that allows players to participate in quiz games and keep track of their scores. It uses an SQLite database for storing quiz results so that players can view and compare past performances.

## Features

* Play quiz games with interactive question-and-answer flow.
* Save player scores in a local database for future reference.
* View a scoreboard showing high scores and player history.
* Easy to install and run on any system with Java and SQLite.

## Project Structure

* **QuizGame.java** – Handles the main game logic, including presenting questions, taking user input, calculating scores, and saving results.
* **Scoreboard.java** – Retrieves and displays saved scores from the database in an organized format.
* **quiz\_scores.db** – Stores player names, scores, and dates of play.
* **quiz\_scores.sqbpro** – A database project file for viewing and editing the database in GUI tools.
* **sqlite-jdbc-3.49.1.0.jar** – The required JDBC driver for enabling Java to connect to SQLite.

## Requirements

* Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
* SQLite installed or an SQLite-compatible viewer.
* SQLite JDBC driver included in the project files.

## How It Works

Players start the quiz through the main game file, answer questions, and receive a score based on their performance. The score, along with the player’s name and date, is stored in the SQLite database. The scoreboard module can then be run to view all past scores in a ranked or chronological order.
